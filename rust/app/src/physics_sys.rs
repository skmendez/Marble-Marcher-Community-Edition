//! M5: fixed-timestep marble physics + WASD/touch input, wired to the demo
//! scene's `SceneState` (rust/DESIGN.md §7/§8).
//!
//! `G` toggles between the two physics models `marble_csg::physics` supports
//! (see its module doc): [`GravityMode::Rolling`] (original MMCE physics —
//! gravity, kill plane, horizontal movement) and [`GravityMode::Flying`]
//! (this branch's zero-gravity free-flight experiment — full 3D
//! camera-relative thrust, no kill plane). Defaults to `Flying` (see
//! `GravityMode`'s doc for why).
//!
//! WASD sign convention: setting `dy = -1` for S moves the marble *toward*
//! the camera's eye position; W (`dy = +1`) moves it away, deeper along the
//! view direction. This is a deliberate user-requested swap of W/S (and, in
//! `camera.rs`, Q/E) from an earlier convention where W was "toward" —
//! verified empirically (not just derived on paper) by logging `marble.pos`
//! before/after holding each key against a live build and checking its
//! displacement's dot product against the camera's `forward` vector.
//! Setting `dx = +1` for D yields `+(cos(yaw), 0, -sin(yaw))`, which is
//! exactly `CameraOrbit`'s `right` vector at zero pitch — D rolls the
//! marble in the camera's screen-right direction (unaffected by the above
//! correction). In `Flying` mode the same `dx`/`dy` inputs instead drive
//! full 3D thrust along wherever the camera is actually pointed (see
//! `step_marble`'s doc).
//!
//! Touch: a 2-finger pinch feeds an additional `dy` (on top of WASD's) via
//! `touch::read_two_finger_gesture` — pinching in pulls the marble toward
//! the camera (S-equivalent), pinching out pushes it away (W-equivalent).
//! Read directly here (not via an `Update`-schedule intermediary) for the
//! same reason WASD is: `Touches`, like `ButtonInput<KeyCode>`, is input
//! state readable from any schedule, not something that needs per-frame
//! accumulation across schedules. The gesture's *rotate* half is handled
//! separately in `touch::touch_camera_input` (`Update` schedule, alongside
//! the mouse-driven `orbit_camera_input`), since it drives `CameraOrbit`,
//! not the marble.
//!
//! **Always-on rollback**: every scene's marble physics runs through a
//! [`RollbackSim`] from scene load, single-player included — see
//! [`MultiplayerSession`]'s doc for why this one path (not "plain
//! `step_marbles` while offline, `RollbackSim` only once connected")
//! replaced an earlier design with exactly that split, and how connecting
//! to a peer *grows* the existing session instead of discarding it.
