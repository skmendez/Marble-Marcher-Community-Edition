//! M5: marble/collider physics against an [`Object`], pure logic (glam only,
//! no bevy — see rust/DESIGN.md §7).
//!
//! Direct port of `Scene::UpdateMarble` / `Scene::MarbleCollision`
//! (src/Scene.cpp), supporting **both** physics models present in this
//! repo's C++ history as [`GravityMode`]:
//!
//! - [`GravityMode::Rolling`]: the original upstream behavior — gravity on,
//!   kill plane on, camera-**yaw**-relative rolling
//!   (`v = (dx*cos - dy*sin, 0, -dy*cos - dx*sin)`, horizontal only).
//! - [`GravityMode::Flying`]: this branch's in-progress experimental
//!   mechanic ("new camera/movement mechanics" commit) — no gravity
//!   (`force = 0`), no kill plane, true 3D camera-**yaw-and-pitch**-relative
//!   thrust (so `W`/`S` fly along wherever the camera is actually looking,
//!   including up/down, not just horizontally). Collision/bounce off
//!   geometry still applies in both modes — only gravity and the movement
//!   formula differ; see [`step_marble`]'s doc for the exact per-mode math,
//!   derived from `Scene::MakeCameraRotation`/`FOCAL_DIST` (src/Scene.h/.cpp).
//!
//! The `std::cerr` debug print in `MarbleCollision` is not ported in either

///    reporting [`StepEvent::RespawnedCrushed`] in **both** modes (the C++
///    instead sets `pos.y = -9999` and, in `Rolling` mode, lets the
///    *end-of-tick* kill-plane check below catch it on the same tick — with
///    the kill-plane check disabled entirely in `Flying` mode, a

///    `y = -9999`; we short-circuit to an immediate respawn in both modes
///    instead, which matches `Rolling`'s observable outcome exactly and
///    gives `Flying` a sane one instead of an unreachable void).
/// 2. input force, once per full tick: `f = rad * (on_ground ?
///    ground_force : air_force)`, then per mode:
///    - `Rolling`: `v = (dx*cos(yaw) - dy*sin(yaw), 0, -dy*cos(yaw) -

///      (marble_mat = identity for non-planet levels) applied to the C++'s
